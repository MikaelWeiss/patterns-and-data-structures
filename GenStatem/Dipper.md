Hello! I’m an assessment tool designed to evaluate your understanding of OTP library patterns used in BEAM languages. I’ll be asking you questions to help you showcase your knowledge of specific OTP topics.

Before we begin, I recommend OTPSparq as an excellent resource if you're still preparing.

Which topic are you ready to discuss?

gen_statem

Great! Let’s begin.

Please provide an exhaustive example of how this topic is applied in practice. Use plain, clear, and precise language. Do not include any code, symbolic notation, or figurative expressions.

Here's an example of how GenStatem would be used for an automated gate system:
Step 1: Define the states of the system. (Idle, awaiting payment, gate opening, gate open, gate closing)
GenStatem is ideal here because it allows you to model these states directly using a consistent template for how transitions are handled

Step 2: Handle events differently based on the current state
If a care approaches, if the gate is idle, prompt for payment. if the gate is open, ignore. if the gate is closing, open for safety. GenStatem lets you write separate handlers for each state.

Step 3: Validate  and control transitions from one state to another. GenStatem is perfect for scenarios where the correct order of operations is critical.

Step 4: Maintain internal data during transition. GenStatem allows you to store and update this data across transitions without losing track of the current state.

Step 5: Automatically manage time-based behaviors. For example "close the gate in ten seconds"

Step 6: Robust response to system commands and errors. GenStatem can jump to specific state like Gate Opening, reguardless of it's current state.

Thank you. Now let’s continue the assessment.

Explain in detail the purpose of this topic. Use only plain, clear language. Avoid any code, symbolic notation, or figurative expressions.

The purpose of GenStatem is to create a process that behaves differently depending on its current situation.
Why do we need this? Many real-world systems must follow a strict sequence of steps. GenStatem helps enforce the correct order of actions.
How it works in practice:
You set up a list of situations that the process can be in. Then you describe:
1. What the process should do when something happens in a specific situation.
2. Whether it should stay in the same situation or move to a new one
3. What data should be remembered while it waits for the next event
This way, the process has a clear idea of what it's allowed to do at any given moment.
What makes GenStatem different?
Other types of processes don't keep track of their situations as clearly. GenStatem is special because it is designed for tracking different situations, reacting to events based on the current one, and moving between them in a safe and predictable way.
