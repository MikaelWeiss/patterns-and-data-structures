In your editor, here is your randomly selected scenario for the topic **Random Access List**: 

Implement a Random Access List with the following functional requirements:

1. **empty(rlist)**

   * Input: A Random Access List.
   * Output: `true` if the list is empty, `false` otherwise.

2. **cons(element, rlist)**

   * Input: An element and a Random Access List.
   * Output: A new Random Access List with the element added to the front.

3. **head(rlist)**

   * Input: A Random Access List.
   * Output: The first element.

4. **tail(rlist)**

   * Input: A Random Access List.
   * Output: The last element.

5. **lookup(rlist, index)**

   * Input: A Random Access List and an index.
   * Output: The element at the specified index.
   * Edge Case: Handle out-of-bounds indices properly.

6. **update(rlist, index, new_value)**

   * Input: A Random Access List, an index, and a new value.
   * Output: A new Random Access List with the specified element updated.

7. **to_list(rlist)**

   * Input: A Random Access List.
   * Output: A list containing all elements in order.

8. **from_list(list)**

   * Input: A standard list.
   * Output: A Random Access List containing the same elements in order.

You must also:

* Utilize recursive definitions wherever appropriate.
* Write tests to validate each function.
* Handle edge cases such as out-of-bounds indices, converting an empty list, and repeated addition or removal of elements.

**Challenge Extension (Optional):**

* `map(rlist, function)`: Apply a function to each element and return a new Random Access List.
* `merge(rlist1, rlist2)`: Combine two Random Access Lists into one.
* `filter(rlist, predicate)`: Return a new Random Access List with only elements that satisfy the predicate.
* `size(rlist)`: Compute the total number of elements.

If you attempt the task and share a solution, I will respond with: **“Please test your code to see if it works.”**
