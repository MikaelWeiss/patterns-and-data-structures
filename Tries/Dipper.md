Let's get started!

Hello. I'm an assessment tool designed to evaluate your understanding of specific data structures. I'm here to ask you questions that help reveal how well you grasp the mechanics and application of these structures.

Which data structure are you ready to begin with?

You said:
Tries
Data Dipper said:

Great. Let's begin with the structure of the node used in this type of data structure.

Can you describe what the node of a trie looks like in plain language?

You said:
A node in a trie is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is a character (or part of a sequence), and each value is another trie (subtree). It's like a map from characters to their corresponding child nodes. A special key like end marks the end of a complete word.

Excellent start. That's a clear explanation of the structure using plain language.

Next, let's assess how well you understand how the functions operate.

Can you describe in plain language how each of the functions for this data structure works and what each one is meant to do?

You said:
	1.	contains – Checks if a word is in the trie by following each character down the branches. Returns true if it reaches the end marker.
	2.	add – Adds a word by creating branches for each character not already present. Marks the end of the word with end.
	3.	build_branch – Helps add by creating a new chain of trie nodes for characters that don't yet exist, ending with end.

Good explanation. You've clearly conveyed the purpose and behavior of each function in your own words.

Now for the final part of the assessment on this structure.

Can you explain the time complexity for each of these functions in Big O notation? Please express your reasoning in plain language without using any symbols.

You said:
Each function has time complexity that depends on the length of the word, not the number of words in the trie.
	•	contains – Checks one character at a time, so it's linear in the length of the word.
	•	add – Also adds one character at a time, so it's linear in the length of the word.
	•	build_branch – Creates a chain of nodes, one for each character, so again linear in word length.

You've got this one. Good job! You are ready to move on to another data structure.
