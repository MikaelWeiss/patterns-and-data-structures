Great â€” let's get started.

Tries

Data CompetentSee said:

In your editor, implement the following functions for the Trie data structure. Each node is a map (or dictionary) with key-value pairs, where keys represent edges and values are child nodes. Use the special key end to mark the end of a sequence.

Functional Requirements

empty(trie)

Input: A Trie.

Output: true if the Trie is empty, false otherwise.

add(trie, sequence)

Input: A Trie and a sequence (such as a string or list).

Output: A new Trie with the sequence added.

contains(trie, sequence)

Input: A Trie and a sequence.

Output: true if the sequence exists in the Trie, false otherwise.

remove(trie, sequence)

Input: A Trie and a sequence.

Output: A new Trie with the sequence removed.

prefix(trie, prefix)

Input: A Trie and a prefix.

Output: A list of all sequences in the Trie that start with the given prefix.

toList(trie)

Input: A Trie.

Output: A list of all sequences stored in the Trie.

fromList(list)

Input: A list of sequences.

Output: A Trie containing all sequences from the list.

Task Instructions

Use functional programming principles.

Use recursive definitions wherever appropriate.

Write tests to validate the correctness of each function.

Ensure your tests include the following scenarios:

Adding duplicate sequences.

Removing sequences that are prefixes of others.

Handling empty sequences or prefixes.

Challenge Extension (Optional):

Implement map(trie, function) to apply a function to each sequence.

Implement merge(trie1, trie2) to combine two Tries.

Implement removePrefix(trie, prefix) to remove all sequences that begin with a prefix.

Implement size(trie) to count the total number of stored sequences.

Let me know when you're ready for another topic.
