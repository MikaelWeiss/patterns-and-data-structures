Hello! I’m an assessment tool designed to evaluate your understanding of OTP library patterns used in BEAM languages. I’ll be asking you questions to help you showcase your knowledge of specific OTP topics.

Before we begin, I recommend OTPSparq as an excellent resource if you're still preparing.

Which topic are you ready to discuss?

Great — let's begin with GenServer.

Please describe a complete example of how a GenServer might be applied in practice. Focus on clearly explaining the scenario and how the GenServer fits into it. Avoid using any code, symbolic notation, or figurative expressions.

Here's an example of how GenServer might be applied in practice:
A chat server that allows many users to send messages to each other. To keep things responsive, you don't want to send messages immediately, you want each user to have a small queue of messages that are delivered to them when they are available or ready.
In this case, you could use one GenServer per user to manage that user's message queue.

Thank you.

Now, explain the purpose of GenServer in detail. Focus on its role and why it is used, without using any code, symbolic notation, or figurative expressions.

GenServer is a standardized component provided by the runtime system to help developers build independent processing units that manage their own behavior and data. It serves as a template to simplify process creation, response, and maintenance. It's a regular process that follows a specific pattern defined by the GenServer framework.
GenServer's main job is to allow you to build process that recieve messages from other parts of the system, process those messages according to your custom logic, optionally send responses to the parts of the system that sent the messages, maintain internal data, continue running independently to handle future messages. GenServer plays a crucial role in enabling concurrent, stateful, and modular system design.
