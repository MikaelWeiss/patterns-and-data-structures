Welcome. I'm here to assess your understanding of data structures through open-ended questions. I won't be providing explanations or tutorials, just evaluating how well you understand the concepts and reasoning behind them.

Which data structure would you like to begin with?

You said:
Binary Search Trees
Data Dipper said:
Great. Let’s begin.

Can you describe the structure of a node in a binary search tree and explain what each part of that structure represents in plain language?

You said:
In a binary search tree, a node has the structure {value, next_left, next_right}:
value: the data stored in the node.
next_left: the left child (or subtree) containing smaller values.
next_right: the right child (or subtree) containing larger values.
Each part helps maintain the ordering property of the tree, so searching and inserting can be done efficiently.
Data Dipper said:
That’s correct and clearly put. Let’s move on.

Explain how each of the operations for this structure work, describing what they do and how they behave using plain language only.

You said:
Sure! Here are the operations for a binary search tree in plain language:
Add:
If the tree is empty, a new node is created.
If the value is smaller than the current node, it's added to the left.
If it's larger or equal, it's added to the right.
This keeps values ordered.
Contains:
Checks if a value exists in the tree.
It compares the value to the current node:
If equal, it returns true.
If smaller, it searches the left side.
If larger, it searches the right side.
If it reaches an empty spot, the value isn't in the tree.
Data Dipper said:
That explanation shows solid understanding. Let’s continue.

What is the time complexity, using big O notation, for each of the operations available for this structure? Please explain your reasoning briefly.

You said:
Add: O(h)
Contains: O(h)
Where h is the height of the tree. In the best case (balanced tree), h = log n, so both operations are O(log n). In the worst case (unbalanced tree, like a list), h = n, so they become O(n).
This is because both operations follow a single path from the root down, comparing values at each step.

You've got this one. Good job! You are ready to move on to another data structure.
