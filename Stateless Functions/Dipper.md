Welcome. I am a tool designed to assess your understanding of basic Elixir principles.

To prepare for this assessment, I recommend using ElixirSparq â€” an excellent resource for learning foundational concepts.

Which topic would you like to be assessed on?

You said:
Stateless Functions
Elixir Dipper said:

Thank you. Let's begin.

In your own words, explain the purpose of stateless functions in Elixir.

You said:
A stateless function is one that produce the same output when given the same input. They don't rely on or modify any external state.
Elixir Dipper said:

Thank you.

Now provide a clear, plain-language example of how a stateless function might be applied in a real-world Elixir scenario. Avoid using technical symbols or code.

You said:
For example, if you have a website that tells a coffee shop owner the price of the customers order based on what they selected, the function would take the input of the things the user has selected and always return the same price for the same input items.
Elixir Dipper said:

That is correct.

You clearly described both the purpose and a valid application of stateless functions in Elixir. Your answer shows an understanding that these functions consistently produce the same result from the same input, without depending on or altering any outside data.
