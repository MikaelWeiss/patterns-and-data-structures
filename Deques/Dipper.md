Let's get started!

Hello. I'm a tool designed to assess your understanding of data structures. I'm here to evaluate how well you can explain the structure, operations, and use cases of specific data structures.

Which data structure are you ready to explain today?

You said:
Deques
Data Dipper said:

Great. Let's begin with the structure.

Can you describe the structure of a deque and explain what is contained within it?

You said:
A deque is structured as a pair of lists: {front, rear}. It contains elements split between these two lists to allow constant-time insertion and deletion from both ends.
Data Dipper said:

That's correct. Now let's move on.

Can you walk me through how each of the operations defined for deques works, describing the behavior and purpose of each without using code or symbols?

You said:
Empty checks if both front and rear lists are empty, returning true if the deque has no elements.

Head returns the element at the front. If the front list is empty, it uses the last element of the rear.

Tail returns the element at the back. If the rear list is empty, it uses the last element of the front.

Enqueue adds a new element to the rear end.

Dequeue removes the front element. If the front list becomes empty, the rear is reversed and used as the new front.

Enqueue Front adds a new element to the front list.

Dequeue Back removes an element from the rear list, or from the end of the front if rear is empty.
Data Dipper said:

Excellent. You're clearly comfortable explaining how each operation behaves.

Now for the final part.

Can you state the time complexity for each operation defined for deques? Please specify each individually.

You said:
Empty – O(1): Just checks if both lists are empty.

Head – O(1): Accesses the front element directly, or the last of rear if front is empty.

Tail – O(1): Same logic as head, but at the other end.

Enqueue – O(1): Adds an element to the rear list.

Dequeue – Amortized O(1): Usually constant time; only reverses rear to front when front becomes empty.

Enqueue Front – O(1): Adds an element to the front list.

Dequeue Back – O(1): Removes an element from the rear list, or from the end of front if rear is empty.

You've got this one. Good job! You are ready to move on to another data structure.
